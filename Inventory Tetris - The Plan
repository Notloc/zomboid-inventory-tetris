Inventory Tetris - The Plan

[GENERAL BUG FIXES]
	Trunks in MP moddata not working 
		Data is getting sent, but the clients are all autopositioning items and sending that data with a newer timestamp
			Might need to go per item and have autopositioned items write 0 for their time
	
[GRAVITY MODE]
	Extra sandbox options (speed)
	Delay buried items instead of preventing

[CONTROLLER SUPPORT]
	Nav
		Improved movement between grids
		Keep selected grid spot in scrollview
	Controls
		Way to split stacks for controller (L3?)
		Need a way to start searching and block controller selection until grid is revealed
		Add way to move faster (Hold X?)

[QoL]
	Allow load gun by dropping mag on equipment ui
		Really we should just process stack drops onto equipment ui slots the exact same as dropping on the itemgrid, allow all drop combos to just work
	
	Gun upgrades without main inventory requirement (Half complete)
		Should probably mess around with crafting and building and mechanics to sanity check some of these main inventory transfer requirements

	Auto sort

	Item swapping!
		(Although, once swapped, the held item becomes overflow.)

	Process controller tooltips before the mouse tooltips


[REASON YOU CANT SYSTEM]
	When an action gets rejected, write the reason into a buffer
	The code that handled the player input can read this post action and display it if new data was written 
		Prevent confusion about why a bag can't accept an item or an item transfer is failing.
		Make it look like RCT2's red text popup

[CLOTHING POCKETS UPDATE]
	Review clothing pocket balance
		Just using the mod support right now, but the uniformity of it is appealing

[FRAGILE]
	Go through everything!
	That includes world containers

====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ====== BETA 6 ======  


[ADDITIONAL CONTROL OPTIONS]
	Goal:
		Allow players to further customize their controls.
		If a player wants the UI to act like Minecraft, why not?
		Provide control scheme presets.

A way to quickly move all of the same item type to target container
