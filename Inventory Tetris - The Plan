Inventory Tetris - The Plan
Score: 1


[GENERAL BUG FIXES] - 10p
	Trunks in MP moddata not working - 5p
		Data is getting sent, but the clients are all autopositioning items and sending that data with a newer timestamp
			Might need to go per item and have autopositioned items write 0 for their time
	
	Math is sketchy when autoscrolling, review and fix - 3p

	Force point filtering for mod item textures via SpriteRenderer - 2p 
		(Remember to check performance implications of this, might need caching/sanity checks)
	
	Hide weight until container is searched when using search mode - 2p

[GRAVITY MODE] - 5p
	Extra sandbox options (speed, self only, world only) - 1p
	Delay buried items instead of preventing - 2p
	Settle items before first render - 1p

[REASON YOU CANT SYSTEM] - 4p
	When an action gets rejected, write the reason into a buffer - 2p
	The code that handled the player input can read this post action and display it if new data was written - 2p
		Prevent confusion about why a bag can't accept an item or an item transfer is failing.
		Make it look like RCT2's red text popup
		
[CONTROLLER SUPPORT] - 9p
	Keep selected grid spot in scrollview - 2p
	Way to split stacks for controller - 2p
	Improved movement between grids - 4p
	Need a way to start searching and block controller selection until grid is revealed - 1p

[QoL]
	Allow load gun by dropping mag on equipment ui - 3p
		Really we should just process stack drops onto equipment ui slots the exact same as dropping on the itemgrid, allow all drop combos to just work
	
	Gun upgrades without main inventory requirement (Half complete) - 1p
		Should probably mess around with crafting and building and mechanics to sanity check some of these main inventory transfer requirements

	A way to quickly move all of the same item type to target container - 1p

	Auto sort - 4p

	Item swapping! - 3p
		(Although, once swapped, the held item becomes overflow.)




[DEV TOOLS]
	Formalize datapack creation - 5p
		Must create and select a pack before able to make edits
		Dev packs are not inherently active
		Export tool uses name in generated lua
		Ability to delete development data per pack

[CLOTHING POCKETS UPDATE]
	Review clothing pocket balance
		Just using the mod support right now, but the uniformity of it is appealing

[FRAGILE]
	Go through everything!
	That includes world containers

[REBALANCE]
	Goal:
		Remove container hyper stacking and make containers more interesting
		Manually set size of every vanilla item

	Implementation Plan:
		Force all non-TARDIS containers to be the same size inside/outside (when not empty)
		Prevent TARDIS containers from containing another container
		Buff TARDIS container sizes but be more strict on allowed items.

[ADDITIONAL CONTROL OPTIONS]
	Goal:
		Allow players to further customize their controls.
		If a player wants the UI to act like Minecraft, why not?
		Provide control scheme presets.
