Inventory Tetris - The Plan

Crafting table
	See mockup

Auto sort
	Organized will buff autosort

Ability to scroll through a stack
	just reorder the item ids ‚ùå
		ids are stored in a map, order is undefined

[GENERAL BUG FIXES]
	Tooltips on overflow
	Drag-n-drop events on overflow
	Quick move events on overflow
	
[GRAVITY MODE]
	Extra sandbox options (speed)
	Delay buried items instead of preventing

[CONTROLLER SUPPORT]
	Nav
		Improved movement between grids
	Controls
		Way to split stacks for controller (L3?)
		Need a way to start searching and block controller selection until grid is revealed
		Add way to move faster (Hold X?)

[QoL]
	Allow load gun by dropping mag on equipment ui
		Really we should just process stack drops onto equipment ui slots the exact same as dropping on the itemgrid, allow all drop combos to just work
	
	Gun upgrades without main inventory requirement (Half complete)
		Should probably mess around with crafting and building and mechanics to sanity check some of these main inventory transfer requirements

	Item swapping!
		(Although, once swapped, the held item becomes overflow.)

	Process controller tooltips before the mouse tooltips


[IN-GAME CONTROL EXPLANATIONS]
	Because I've now seen 12hrs of gameplay where the youtuber didn't use any convenience controls, not even once

[REASON YOU CANT SYSTEM]
	When an action gets rejected, write the reason into a buffer
	The code that handled the player input can read this post action and display it if new data was written 
		Prevent confusion about why a bag can't accept an item or an item transfer is failing.
		Make it look like RCT2's red text popup

[MULTI SELECT]
	Hold shift to select - Customizable
	Items get highlighted, next action is processed on all selected items

[Multiplayer]
	Trunks in MP moddata not working 
		Data is getting sent, but the clients are all autopositioning items and sending that data with a newer timestamp
			Might need to go per item and have autopositioned items write 0 for their time

	See about fixing nested containers on the floor
		Stutter the object in and out of the inventory to force a sync???

[REBALANCE]
	Split base datapack into several
		One per category
